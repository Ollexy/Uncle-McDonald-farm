Last year of my graduate studies, I realized that this field of study is not what I want to do in my life, so I started looking for a different career path. At that time, I was talking to a friend who is a programmer and he told me a lot about it. I started exploring the subject of programming and found Out that I like it. So I thought maybe this is a career path I should follow. Besides, what pushed me forward the most in this direction is the freedom and possibilities that this work gives.
