About me
In the last year of master's studies, I found that they are not something I want to do in my life, so I started looking for a different career path. At that time, I was talking to a friend who is a programmer and he told me a lot about it. I started exploring the subject of programming and it turned out to be something that I started to like. That's why I figured maybe this is a career path I should follow. Besides, what pushed me the most in this direction is the freedom and opportunities that such work can offer.
